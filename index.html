    				<div class="white1"> <p class="style1"> Kyoto City is surrounded by mountains in Western Honshu, and seems to have a reputation worldwide as Japan's most beautiful city. Your first impression may be of the urban city of central Kyoto, surrounded by tall glass and steel skyscrapers with modern architecture, but the persistent tourist will soon be one to discover the effort and painstaking time it takes to see Kyoto's hidden beauty is worth every bit. Discover Kyoto's hidden beauty in the temples and parks which ring the city center, and find that the city has much more than immediately meets the eye. (KK. JP) </p> </div>

    				<div class="white2"> <p class="style1"> Not only is Kyoto a tourist paradise, but the city hosted the conference for the international Global warming crisis. The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement on global warming dispatched by the United Nations Conference held on Climate Change in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. The objective of the protocol is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The major industrial nations pledged to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012. (K) </p> </div>
