    				<div class="white1"> <p class="style1"> Kyoto was founded in 794, and continued to be the capital of Japan until 1868. Since the city's industry catered to the imperial court and upper classes, renowned artists and craftsman established a high cultural and artistic aesthetic which continues to be seen today.During the second World War, the United States bombed many cities throughout Japan, but opted to save the historically rich capital. Thus, Kyoto remains one of the best preserved cities in Japan, and many neighborhoods look the same as they did 100 years ago. Despite it's centuries of old history, Kyoto is also undeniably a modern city with high-rise buildings and busy thoroughfares. It is this, inter-woven with humble wooden machi-ya (traditional townhouses), and austere temples and shrines, which creates a strange and beautiful landscape that one is unable to see in any other modern city in Japan. Since it was first established, the Heian emperor Kanmu arranged the city in a grid pattern modeled after the capital of China, Chang'an. Central Kyoto's streets still remain in this style, making navigation easy. (Kyoto Kyoto. JP) </p> </div>

    				<div class="white2"> <p class="style1"> Compared to the past, crime rate has slowly increased but generally speaking, Japan is known as a peaceful and orderly country. It is safe for women to walk alone at night and in the city, you can always catch a glimpse of people roaming the streets till the early morning on weekends.Even within Japan, Kyoto is considered a unique and special place. Every year before the change of a season, many magazines and books feature articles about Kyoto and often times, those published become best sellers. Some of Japanese tourists are repeating visitors. Kyoto experiences cold winters and humid summers as it is located in a valley surrounded by mountains. Resting atop a large natural water table, many freshwater wells are located in the city. Even today, Kyoto is where Japanese visit to go back to their traditional roots and culture. Though increasingly hard to find, Kyoto refuses to give up some of its traditional ways of life. Geisha speak in old Kyoto dialect, tofu is sold in carts door to door, and crafts-people continue to keep their family businesses in operation for over 20 generations. (Kyoto Kyoto. JP) </p> </div>
